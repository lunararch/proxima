# ADR-0001: Use Architectural Decision Records

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to track key design decisions for the Go-Linux distribution project to ensure consistency and enable future contributors to understand the reasoning behind choices.

## Decision
We will use Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) to document all significant architectural and design decisions.

## Consequences
- **Positive**: Clear decision history, easier onboarding, consistent reasoning
- **Negative**: Additional documentation overhead
- **Neutral**: ADRs stored in `adr/` directory, numbered sequentially
